the goal of this is to comes pascal into life for security purpose . 
alot of coders who use C++ / C think that pascal is not that powerful 

for that reason i will focus on this repo about making snippets , codes, projects related to penetration testing scope , red teaming toolkits

since sharing is caring . knowledge is something should we emerge every day
